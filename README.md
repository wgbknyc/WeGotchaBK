#About WeGotchaBK

  WeGotchaBK was founded on a simple belief: reliable transportation should never feel like a luxury. It should be accessible, affordable, and designed around the real lives of the people who depend on it every day.Founded by **Jermaine Smith**, a Georgia-raised entrepreneur who recently relocated to New York, WeGotchaBK was shaped by firsthand experience. Like many residents, students, and healthcare workers, Jermaine quickly encountered the daily realities of congestion, long delays, overcrowding, and rising transportation costs. Navigating the city revealed just how difficult it can be to move efficiently through essential corridors — especially when time, work, and family responsibilities are on the line. Those experiences became the foundation for building something better.
  
  WeGotchaBK exists to bridge the gap between traditional public transit and personal transportation. Our microtransit model is designed to deliver fast, dependable, and comfortable service along high-demand routes, with a focus on consistency and community needs. Through smart routing, affordable pricing, and customer-centered operations, we are building a system that keeps people moving without unnecessary stress or expense.As we prepare for our upcoming pilot launch, WeGotchaBK is committed to rewarding early riders with special incentives, including free service periods once our platform is fully operational. Our growing fleet and scalable model position us as a strong new competitor in local transportation — one that prioritizes sustainability, reliability, and long-term service.

WeGotchaBK is more than a ride. It is a commitment to convenience, speed, and comfort. We are here to serve, to listen, and to evolve with our community. Our purpose is clear: to provide dependable transportation that empowers people to reach their destinations with confidence — today and for years to come.
